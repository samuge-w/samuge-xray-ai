    fix: Resolve Docker build issues and PORT configuration
    
    - Fixed server.js PORT to use 10000 (matches Render configuration)
    - Updated Dockerfile to use available Python3 packages instead of Python 3.12
    - Fixed Python symbolic links to match installed version
    - Resolves Docker build failure with apt-get install error
    
    Context7 + Render MCP collaboration: Express.js port configuration
    and Docker compatibility fixes for successful deployment.
